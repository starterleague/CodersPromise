As a Code Academy student and alum, I promise to...

continue to make memes using Neal's face.
promote every Code Academy post on Built in Chicago.
show up for class on time, every time, but if I'm late, apologize to Jeff.
say "rake db:migrate" in Jeff's voice whenever possible.
RSVP to geekfest on gathers.us instead of just show up for lunch.
meet with my mentor when I'm supposed to.
treat my mentor with the utmost respect and kindness.
close all my windows and programs when I'm done at an iMac.
pair with someone I don't know each class until I know all my classmates.
write a blog post every week about my progress in Code Academy.
turn my ringer off before class starts (including vibrates).
not text or check my email while class is in session.
not whisper or talk while Jeff is teaching.
throw out my empty coffee cups and wrappers.
do whatever Jeff gives us for homework.
not delete files from the Dropbox.
clean up the kitchen and help out as much as possible.
build what I learned in class from scratch, and then do it again.
